### Introduction

This second programming assignment is to create an R
function that caches time-consuming computations.

For example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast
operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to
compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g.
in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make
sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it
can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this
Programming Assignment you will take advantage of the scoping rules of
the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside
of an R object.

### Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

The first function, `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix", which is
really a list containing a function to

1.  set the value of the matrix
2.  get the value of the matrix
3.  set the value of the inverse
4.  get the value of the inverse

<!-- -->
    
    makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
            x <<- y
            m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
    }

The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
inverse has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the mean from the
cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of
the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the `setinverse`
function.
    
    cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
            message("getting cached data")
            return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- apply(data,c(1,2),function(d)1/d)
        x$setinverse(m)
        m
    }
